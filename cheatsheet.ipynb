    "## Introduction to Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is an essential tool in modern software development that solves environment consistency problems across different machines and deployment scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Docker is Important:**\n",
    "- Crucial for Open Source contributions\n",
    "- Essential for Microservices architecture\n",
    "- Must-have skill for Developers, DevOps Engineers, and Full Stack Engineers\n",
    "- Used by virtually every repository today\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Development Environment Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** Two developers working on the same project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Developer 1 Environment:**\n",
    "- Windows OS\n",
    "- Node.js version 16\n",
    "- MongoDB version 5\n",
    "- Redis version 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Developer 2 Environment:**\n",
    "- Mac OS\n",
    "- Node.js version 20 (latest)\n",
    "- MongoDB version 7 (latest)\n",
    "- Redis version 7 (latest)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems Encountered:**\n",
    "1. **Environment Replication Difficulty**: Hard to remember and communicate all dependencies\n",
    "2. **Version Conflicts**: Different versions cause application failures\n",
    "3. **OS-Specific Issues**: Some tools only work on specific operating systems\n",
    "4. **Cloud Deployment Challenges**: Same configuration issues repeat in production\n",
    "5. **Team Scaling Problems**: Impossible to manually configure environments for large teams\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Docker Solves These Problems\n",
    "- Creates isolated containers with consistent environments\n",
    "- Allows sharing of container configurations\n",
    "- Ensures \"works on my machine\" becomes \"works everywhere\"\n",
    "- Lightweight and portable across different systems\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Install Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Docker Desktop**\n",
    "   - Visit [docker.com](https://docker.com)\n",
    "   - Download for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux)\n",
    "   - Includes both Docker CLI and Docker Desktop GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Installation**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker --version\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Example output: `Docker version 24.0.6`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Components Installed:**\n",
    "   - **Docker Daemon**: The core engine that manages containers\n",
    "   - **Docker CLI**: Command-line interface\n",
    "   - **Docker Desktop**: GUI for visualization\n",

    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Images vs Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Images:**\n",
    "- Template/blueprint for containers\n",
    "- Like an operating system snapshot\n",
    "- Contains application code, dependencies, and configuration\n",
    "- Stored locally or on Docker Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "**Containers:**\n",
    "- Running instances of images\n",
    "- Isolated execution environments\n",
    "- Lightweight and portable\n",
    "- Multiple containers can run from the same image\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Docker Hub\n",
    "- Public registry for Docker images (like GitHub for code)\n",
    "- Contains official and community images\n",
    "- Source for pulling base images\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
